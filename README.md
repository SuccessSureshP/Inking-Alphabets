# Inking-Alphabets
This is Microsoft UWP (Universal Windows Platform) App mainly using new Inking capabilities. Learning new language with this App is really fun to anyone. I hope kids love this app. This has features like "Learn Alphabets", "Add new language", "Inking Slate" and "Inking words"

This App is already available in Windows Store. It will be available to all markets pretty soon.
